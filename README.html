<h1>improvedpolygoncapturing2</h1>

<p>Improved Polygon Capturing is a <a href="http://www.qgis.org">QGIS</a> <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> plugin, that allows to digitize new polygons or lines with predefined edge lengths and angles, as you would do in a CAD program.</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>The plugin adds a new icon to the digitizing toolbar. <img src="ressources/icon.png" alt="icon" /></p>

<p>Select a polygon or a line layer and toggle editing by clicking on the new icon.</p>

<p>A Dockable palette will appear.</p>

<p>From now on, you can enter the distance or the angle numerically in the edit fields. You have to check the "Lock" checkbox to actually lock the distance and/or the angle. Unlocked fields are entered using the mouse (which takes snapping into account).</p>

<p>You can also switch between absolute angle or relative angles (relatives angles are relative to the last line segment) by checking the "delta" icon.</p>

<p>Similar to the standard editing tools, left mouse clicks add new vertexes while right mouse clicks finish the geometry.</p>

<p>After finishing a new geometry the feature form opens and attributes can be entered.</p>

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>

<p>The following shortcuts are available:</p>

<ul>
<li>alt+1 : focus the distance edit field</li>
<li>alt+2 : focus the angle edit field</li>
<li>alt+shift+1 : toggle the distance lock box</li>
<li>alt+shift+2 : toggle the angle lock box</li>
<li>alt+shift+3 : toggle the absolute angle box</li>
</ul>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>The plugin calculates the distance in plain trigonometry. Thus <strong>it is not recommended to use it in unprojected systems</strong> like EPSG:4326.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Improved polygon capturing plugin has been initially developed in June 2010 for a <a href="http://www.gtz.de/en/weltweit/asien-pazifik/30296.htm">land management and registration</a> project in the Lao PDR by Adrian Weber.</p>

<p>It was used to digitize land parcels with known edge lengths from high-resolution satellite images. The parcel edges have been measured a priori in the field.</p>

<h2>Version history</h2>

<ul>
<li>Version 0.8 (June 2010): first published version</li>
<li>Version 0.9 (February 2011): added support for polyline layers and bug fixing</li>
<li>Version 1.0 (July 2011): feature form opens in editing mode after finishing a new feature</li>
<li>Version 1.1 (December 2012): added support for angle and updated interface</li>
</ul>
